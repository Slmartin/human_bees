We present an extension to an existing model for the description of work allocation in insect socities as developed by Theraulaz et al. The extensions to the model allow the investigation of external perturbations and the investigation of a society of non-constant size.
Based on the Theraulaz model, we developed the Productivity-Boredom-Money (PBM) model in order that is able to describe other features of a society. It is more adequate to describe a society of rational workers that work for the own benefit, as it includes money. The PBM model also allows the investigation of work division, and, being more oriented towards a human society, is also able to describe features such as social inequalities.
