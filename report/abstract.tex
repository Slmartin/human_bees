We present an extension to an existing model for the description of work allocation in insect societies as developed by Theraulaz et al. The extensions to the model allow for the investigation of external perturbations and the investigation of a society of non-constant size.
Based on the Theraulaz model, we developed the Productivity-Boredom-Money (PBM) model that is able to describe complementary features of a society. It is more adequate to describe a society of rational workers that work for the own benefit, as it includes money. The PBM model also allows the investigation of work division, and, being more oriented towards a human society, is also able to describe features such as social inequalities.
