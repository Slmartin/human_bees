\subsection{Alternative model}

In order to investigate the influence of external perturbations, a more robust model was derived from the model proposed by XXXX. We name this model the MMM model.

\subsubsection{Basic principle}
The MMM model describes the dynamics of the work allocation of different taks in a society of workers. 
A worker is not equally skilled for all of the tasks; we define his \emph{productivity} for a task as the amount of work (or produced units) in a given time. 
The productivity of a worker for a given tasks evolves with time, depending on whether he is actually performing the task or not, which reproduces learning and forgetting. Similarly, the \emph{boredom} of the worker regarding the tasks evolves. For a worker, the boredom is equivalent to earning less money.
Each worker is remunerated for his work; as all the tasks are considered to be equally important for the society, they all deliver the same total amount of money, which is distributed to the workers proportionally to their productivity.
Every now and then, the worker is given the possibility to quit his task and choose another task, which he will do if he can get a better salary/boredom balance. 


\subsubsection{Implementation details}
The initial value for the productivity $P_{ij}$ of worker $i$ at task $j$ is generated randomly according to the equation
\begin{equation}
	P_{ij}(t_0) = 
\end{equation}
In order to describe the fact that some people intrinsically learn faster than other people and have more room for improvement, each worker $i$ is attributed a task-independent \emph{ability} $A_i$, which is time-independent and generated randomly according to
\begin{equation}
	A_{i} = 
\end{equation}
The maximal productivity of worker $i$ at task $j$ is directly related to his initial productivity at this task and his ability:
\begin{equation}
	P_{ij}^\textrm{max} = A_i \cdot P_{ij}(t_0)
\end{equation}
The productivity evolves in time as a function of the learning factor $\lambda$ and of the forgetting factor $\kappa$, 
\begin{equation}
	P_{ij}(t+\Delta t) = \begin{cases}
		P_{ij}(t) + (P_{ij}^\textrm{max}-P_{ij}(t)) \cdot \lambda \Delta t & \text{if worker $i$ is performing task $j$}\\
		P_{ij}(t) - P_{ij}(t) \cdot \kappa \Delta t & \text{otherwise}\\
		\end{cases}
\end{equation}
where $\Delta t$ is the time step for the time evolution.

The boredom $B_{ij}$ of worker $i$ at task $j$ is initially zero at time $t_0$. The maximal boredom $B_{ij}^\textrm{max}$ is generated randomly by the following formula:
\begin{equation}
	B_{ij}^\textrm{max} = 
\end{equation}
The evolution of the boredom evolves in a similar fashion as the productivity and depends on the parameters $\zeta$ and $\eta$ for the boredom increase and decrease, respectively:
\begin{equation}
	B_{ij}(t+\Delta t) = \begin{cases}
		B_{ij}(t) + (B_{ij}^\textrm{max}-B_{ij}(t)) \cdot \zeta \Delta t & \text{if worker $i$ is performing task $j$}\\
		B_{ij}(t) - B_{ij}(t) \cdot \eta \Delta t & \text{otherwise}\\
		\end{cases}
\end{equation}
The \emph{job offer probability} $p_s$ is responsible for the occasional possibility given to the worker to change his task: at each time step, a worker has this choice if a random number distributed uniformly between $0$ and $1$ is smaller than $p_s$.
