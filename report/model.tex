%Model

The model describes the development of a bee hive. The colony consists of $M$ bees, denoted with index $i$ ($i=1,2,..,M$). Assume that there are $N$ tasks, denoted by $j$ ($j=1,2,..,N$). These tasks need to be performed in order for the colony to survive. They are associated with dynamic stimuli, denoted with $s_{j}$. The stimuli $s_{j}$, represent a measure of how urgent a specific task $j$ needs to be performed. If a task is not pursued by enough workers of the hive or not in a sufficient rate, the need or the stimulus for the specific task will increase. Let $\theta_{ij}$ be the treshold for an individuum $i$ with respect to task $j$. Then the probability for an individuum $i$ to take up task $j$ is given by
\begin{equation} 
T_{\theta_{ij}}=\frac{s^{2}_{j}}{s^{2}_{j}+\theta^{2}_{ij}}
\end{equation}
One can see that for 
\begin{center}
$s_{j} \gg \theta_{ij}$, $T_{\theta_{ij}}$ $\to 1$; \\
$s_{j}$ = $\theta_{ij} $, $T_{\theta_{ij}}$= 0.5; \\
$s_{j} \ll \theta_{ij}$,  $T_{\theta_{ij}}$ $\to 0$.

\end{center}
 So the higher the demand (or stimulus) for a task, the more probable it is for a bee to engages in it. Each individual bee $i$ has a specific threshold $\theta_{ij}$ towards a given task $j$. Those bees $i$, that have a low $\theta_{ij}$ towards a task $j$ will perform this task with a higher probability $T_{\theta_{ij}}$. Moreover, the thresholds vary over time as they reflect the ability of a human bee to perform a specific task. In full analogy to humans, a human bee $i$ becomes better as it performs a specific task $j$ during the time fraction $x_{ij}$. \textit{Vice versa}, during time fraction ($1-x_{ij}$), in which it does not perform this task, its ability to perform it, slowly decreases. Let $\phi$ be a fixed parameter associated with the learning process of a task and $\zeta$  fixed parameter associated with the forgetting process of a task. Then the temporal change of $\theta_{ij}$ is described by

\begin{equation} 
\partial \theta_{ij} = [(1-x_{ij})\phi-x_{ij}\zeta]\Theta(\theta_{ij}-\theta_{min})\Theta(\theta_{max}-\theta_{ij})
\end{equation}
where $\Theta(y)$ simply denotes a step-function:
\begin{equation}
\Theta(y) = \begin{cases}
  0,  & \text{if $y \le 0$ }\\
  1, & \text{if $y > 0.$}
\end{cases}
\end{equation}
$\Theta$ is used to maintain $\theta_{ij}$ within the chosen boundaries [$\theta_{min}, \theta_{max}$]. Note that $\phi$ as well as $\zeta$ assume the same, constant value for each task. The temporal change of $x_{ij}$ is given by
\begin{equation} 
\partial x_{ij}= T_{\theta_{ij}}(s_{j})(1-\sum \limits_{i=1}^{M}x_{ij})-px_{ij}+\Psi(i,j,t)
\end{equation} 
The first term of the right hand side describes how the fraction of potentially free time $(1-\sum \limits_{i=1}^{M}x_{ij})$ is actually allocated to task performance $j$. The second term describes that a human bee stops performing a task and becomes inactive with probability p. p is identical and constant for all tasks and $1/p$ denotes the average time spent on task $j$. So our model requires a human bee to become inactive before it can continue to pursue a task in the next time interval, if the stimulus is high enough.

$\Psi(i,j,t)$ is...........???

Assuming that the demand for each task increases at a fixed rate $\delta$ per unit time, the temporal change of s is given by
\begin{equation}
\partial s_{j}=\delta - \frac{\alpha}{N}(\sum \limits_{i=1}^{N}x_{ij})
\end{equation}

where $\alpha$ denotes a scale factor measuring the efficiency of task performance. Note that $\alpha$ assumes the same, constant value for all tasks.
