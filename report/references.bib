	abstract = {A model of division of labour in insect societies, based on variable response thresholds is introduced. Response thresholds refer to the likelihood of reacting to task-associated stimuli. Low-threshold individuals perform tasks at a lower level of stimulus than high-threshold individuals. Within individual workers, performing a given task induces a decrease in the corresponding threshold, and not performing the task induces an increase in the threshold. This combined reinforcement process leads to the emergence of specialized workers, i.e. workers that are more responsive to stimuli associated with particular task requirements, from a group of initially identical individuals. Predictions of the dynamics of task specialization resulting from this model are presented. Predictions are also made as to what should be observed when specialists of a given task are removed from the colony and reintroduced after a varying amount of time: the colony does not recover the same state as that prior to the perturbation, and the difference between before and after the perturbation is more strongly marked as the time between separation and reintroduction increases.},

	abstract = {A simple model of regulation of division of labour in insect societies is introduced and studied. Individuals are assumed to respond to task-related stimuli with response thresholds. When the intensity of a particular stimulus exceeds an individual's response threshold, the individual engages in task performance with high probability, and successful task performance reduces the intensity of the stimulus. If individuals belonging to different (physical or behavioural) castes have different response thresholds, and if thresholds are assumed to remain fixed over the timescales of experiments, this model can account for some observations on ant species of Pheidole (Wilson 1984).},
