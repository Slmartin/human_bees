\subsection{Theraulaz Model}
\subsubsection*{Division of labour}
The Theraulaz Model is able to simulate the divison of labour. In Fig.\ref{fig:thetax} on the left we see the development of the thresholds $\theta_{ij}$ as a function of time. For each individuum $i$ there is one line with respect to each task $j$. Here, we have used N=5 bees and M=2 tasks, amounting to 10 depicted lines - one line for each task for each bee. We can see that in the beginning the values of $\theta_{ij}$ oscillate and then assume a steady state from approximately $t=3000$ on. In this steady state, exactly five lines assume the constant maximum value $\theta_{ij}=1000$ and five lines assume the constant minimum value $\theta_{ij}=0$. This means that the five bees specialize in exactly one task and keep performing this single task in the steady state.

	\caption{$\theta$ as a function of time (M=2, N=5).}
	\label{fig:thetax}
\end{figure}

This behaviour can be explained as follows. In the beginning, the five bees have no preference for any task as their $\theta=500$ for all tasks. In other words, there is no specialization yet. First, a bee tries out to perform one of the two tasks and gets inactive with a certain probability over time. It might subsequently decide to continue pursuing its first task or alternatively perform the second one. This decision is influenced by two factors. First, by the choice of the other bees. If all bees perform task 1, the stimulus for this task will be negligible compared to the increasing stimulus for task 2 and it becomes more likely to perform this second task. Second, by the skills the bee has gained or forgotten with respect to a specific task. The more time a bee spends pursuing task 1, the better it gets performing it. In our model, the bee is then more likely to continue pursuing this task. Vice versa is true for a task which is not performed regularly by a bee. Therefore, what we observe is that some bees will exclusively perform task 1, thus $\theta_{j=1}=0$ and $\theta_{j=2}=1000$ in the steady state, and others decide to perform task 2, thus $\theta_{j=2}=0$ and $\theta_{j=1}=1000$. The model consequently allows for the investigation of the division of labour in societies. Driving force for the division is the specialization by a learning and forgetting process.
In Fig.\ref{fig:thetax}  on the right we can see x as a function of time.

\subsubsection{Measurement of the development and performance of a society}
Our model enables the description of the performance of the bee hive. In Fig.\ref{fig:welstim} the thresholds, the corresponding stimuli with respect to task $j=1, 2$ as well as the corresponding total welfare W of the society is depicted. The behaviour of the thresholds is analogous to what is already described in Fig.\ref{fig:thetax}. The corresponding stimuli increase in time, reach a maximum value at approximately time=500 and subsequently decrease to zero. Remarkably, the stimulus of task 2 decreases slower than that of task 1. The development of the welfare curve is closely related to the development of the stimuli. At times the stimuli are high the welfare is low. Thus, the welfare first decreases, goes through a minimum at approximately time=500 and then slowly increases to reach its maximum value of 1. Note that in all graphs all functions reach its steady state value at approximately time=3000.

\begin{figure}[ht!]

	\caption{Left: Tresholds $\theta$ as a function of time. Middle: Stimuli $s_{j}$ for task 1 and two as a function of time. Right: Welfare W as a function of time.}
	\label{fig:welstim}
\end{figure}

The functions can be interpreted as follows. The development of the stimuli can be explained by the fact that it takes time for the bees to reach an equilibrium state -- the state where all bees assume exactly one task. Up to this point, the needs of the hive are not sufficiently satisfied. Hence, the stimuli increase. Over time, the bees become more specialized towards a specific task and the stimuli go through a maximum to decrease subsequently. This is an expression that the tasks are performed with a sufficient efficiency. The individual development of the thresholds and stimuli is governed by how fast the bees manage to specialize themselves and satisfy the need for the respective task. In the presented case, for example, one can look at the stimulus and the threshold value which converge last to their equilibrium value - stimulus 2 and threshold $\theta_{22}$. Stimulus 2 decreases slower than stimulus 1, so the need to perform 2 is greater for a longer period of time compared to task 1. This is reflected in the curve of $\theta_{22}$. It remains low as long as stimulus 2 is high and only then converges to 1000. This means that bee 2 engages as long in task 2 as stimulus 2 remains high. Thereafter it becomes inactive with respect to task 2 and is thus the last bee to be fully specialized. The welfare is connected to the sum of the stimuli. The stimuli are high when the hive need that specific tasks need to be performed in order for the hive to survive. Whenever a task is not performed, or to an insufficient extent, the respective stimulus is high. High stimuli thus reflect a poor state. Vice versa, low stimuli show that the hive performs well. Therefore, we have introduced the welfare model which is based on the sum of the stimuli. When the sum of the stimuli is low, indicating a good performance of the hive, the welfare increases. Hence, our model is able to describe how well specific tasks are performed and to measure the total welfare of a population over time.

\subsubsection{Perturbations}
The Theraulaz Model 1 has been analyzed with respect to an isolated society. It has been used to describe domestic characteristics of a society, such as division of labour and welfare. However, we also want to investigate how the model can be used to describe external perturbations, where the work environment is changed or individuals can get killed (or are otherwise removed). Therefore, we have studied the response of the model with respect to perturbations such as reinitializing either a random bee, or every bee or every bee perform a same task.
In the following, we will consider the special case in which the colony consists of five bees and two tasks. Before starting a deep analysis, it is important to know that for this specific setup the bees usually reach an equilibrium state in which two bees work on a task and the three others work on the other task. 

\paragraph{Reinitializing one bee}

Let us initially assume that the model has reached an equilibrium before being subject to a perturbation. We will start with a simple case: reset the associated features $x_{ij}$ and $\theta{ij}$ of a single bee. Here, we need to consider two cases. First, the removed bee was working on the task performed by only a single other bee. Second, the removed bee was performing its task together with two other bees.

In Fig.\ref{fig:figure1} $\theta_{ij}$ and $x_{ij}$ of all bees are shown as a function of time. During this time, we have randomly reinitiated a single bee at approximately 2300, 3900 and 7200 iterations. This can be seen at the discontinuities for the corresponding $\theta_{ij}$ and $x_{ij}$ graphs. To study case 1, we can look at the perturbation at 3900 iterations, as indicated by an arrow. Here, bee three was reinitialized, thus $x_{i=3,j=1}=0$ and $\theta_{i=3,j}=500$. As one can see the $x_{ij}$ and $\theta{ij}$ values for all other bees remain unaffected. The $\theta{i=3,j}$ and $x_{i=3,j}=0$ values of bee three are reset but converge to their initital values again. This means that for case one the system is robust in the sense that the same equilibrium is reached as prior to the perturbation. The unaffected bees continue to work and the reinitialized bee returns to its initial work again. In Fig.5 the change in stimuli for the two cases of perturbations is shown. After initial specialization both stimuli converge to a value close to zero and at the time of the perturbation we see a great increase of $s_{j=1}$ after the perturbation. This is due to bee one not performing its initial task efficiently enough. It takes lots of iterations for the stimulus one to reach its its equilibrium again. 

\begin{figure}[ht!]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{figures/figure1.png}
	\caption{Reinitializing a bee working on a task fulfilled by only one other bee after 3900 iterations.}
	\label{fig:figure1}
\end{figure}

For the second case, we can look at the reinitialization taking place at 3200 iterations (see arrows in Fig.\ref{fig:figure2}). In this case a bee ($i=1$) was removed, which was working together with two other bees ($i=2,3$) on a single task. We observe that $x_{i=2,3,j}$ increase after removing bee one. The corresponding values for bee 4 and 5 remain unaffected, however. Subsequently to the reinitialization, $x_{i=1,j}$ and $\theta_{i=1,j=1,2}$ converge 0 and 1000, respectively. In Fig. 5 we can see that opposed to case one we do not induce a great change in the stimuli (note the zoom of the y-axis). However, we observe a small, though significant increase of both stimuli after the perturbation. Interestingly, after the perturbation the stimuli do not converge to their initial values but remain relatively high. Moreover, the variances of $s_{j=1}$ has changed after the perturbation: Before the shock it was smaller than after the shock. In Fig.6 we have quantified the impact of the perturbance as average over 500 runs: We see that the difference in mean and variance of $s_{j=1}$ increases significantly. 
The results show that the former partners of bee 1 step up and work more intensively to compensate for the reinitialization of bee 1. Interestingly, bee 1 does not perform any task after the perturbation. The thresholds for task 1 and 2 reach the maximum value so the bee remains inactive and enjoys life on the cost of others. These changes represent a transition from one equilibrium to another. The increase in the mean and variance of $s_{j=1}$ show that the system is more stable (as indicated by a smaller variance) as when only 2 bees are performing a task.

\subsubsection{Recovery time}

\begin{figure}[ht!]

\label{fig:figure5}
\caption{Mean recovery time and associated standard deviation for diverse perturbations. The plot is based on more than 100 runs.}
\end{figure}
\par\end{center}

A straightforward measure for the intensity of a perturbation is the time needed to achieve an equilibrium state again. This is achieved when the level of stimuli assume a low, approximately constant value (we have set the threshold for s to be equal or lower to 5). For this purpose, we have run many simulations to estimate the average recovery time for various perturbations. With perturbations we mean resetting the bees, however, one can easily abstract our model to the real world. Think for example of an accident in a coal mine: All miners could be killed by a single accident and the society needs to train new workers which are skilled enough to work in mines. This scenario can be simulated using our model by resetting individuals working on the same task. 

In total four different cases have been explored which are shown in Fig. 7. In the very left, a single bee is reset. We have considered only cases where this bee was engaged in a task which was performed of two bees in total. In cases where more than two bees were fulfilling a task the recovery was found to be immediate, thus these cases are neglected. We can see that an in average about 3614 iterations were needed to reach equilibrium again. In the second case, we have reinitialized all bees. Here, an average recovery time of 1476 is observed. In the last two cases we have reset all bees responsible for a single task. In case three we have reset 2 out of 2 bees performing a task and in case 4 we have reset 3 out of 3 bees. The corresponding recovery times are 2981 and 10244, respectively. These results are very surprising at first: The recovery time for resetting three bees is the lower than resetting only 2 or only 1 bee. This can probably be explained by a greater increase in the last case: Removing more bees also induces a greater increase in stimulus. This increase consequently leads to a faster adaption of the society. In other words, it reacts faster when the problems are more urgent. This might represent an analogy to human society: Challenges such as climate change illustrate that important tasks do not get tackled quickly if the stimulus is not high enough. Only when the stimulus or the urgency is high and felt by a majority of individuals, then a quick change is done. Coming back to our model we can introduce a rule of thumb: For a given number of tasks (being concerned by the reinitialization) a greater number of bees involved implies a faster recovery and, on the other hand, for a given number of bees, a greater number of tasks implies a slower recovery.
Therefore, this method is a good way to quantify the intensity of some perturbation. However this approach is limited to simple cases where recovery can be observed.

\subsection{Dynamical Population within the Theraulaz Model}

The assumption that the colony size does not evolve in time is an
important simplification of the reality. Therefore, we have attempted
to extend the previous model to a more dynamical one.


\subsubsection{Model Extension}

The crucial extension is that $N$ is now depending on time. This
is a fundamental change in the model and it raises many new implementation
problems. First, the size of the vector that is processed by the ordinary
differential equation solver changes frequently; to solve this problem
a more dynamical solver is required. Second, the number of bees is
one of the dominant factors influencing the computational intensity
of the simulation; N should therefore reach some sort of dynamical
equilibrium or stay within a given range. And finally, it is more complicated
to keep track of the full history of the variables.

About the extension, on one hand, a probability of birth of a
bee was introduced which dependent linearly on the welfare of the
colony. This appears to be a natural choice, since the welfare was
defined as the ability of the society to fulfill all its needs. On
the other hand, a probability of death was also introduced which is
inversely proportional to the welfare. This stochastic
approach allows to get a more realistic model, since birth can occur
even in difficult moments. Those are the main changes, the other ones
are mainly technical and will not be presented in this report.

\subsubsection{First results}

Before considering the result of the extend model, we will have a look
at some simple cases

First, we can observe in Fig. 8 that killing a bee that used
to work on a task performed by only one other bee, implies a sudden increase in stimulus for the concerned task, which reaches a maximum after approximately 6700 iterations. We can also notice that at the same time abrupt changes in the level of $x_{21}$ and $x_{22}$ happen and that the level of $x_{32}$ and $x_{42}$ slightly increase. Those changes show that, on one side, under the increasing pressure induced by the stimulus, a bee switches its specialization. On the other side, the two bees that did not make the effort to switch task, need to work harder in order to compensate the loss induced by the change in specialization.

\begin{figure}
\centerline{\includegraphics[scale=0.42]{figures/Figure4}}
\label{fig:figure6}
\caption{Reorganization of the colony after the death of a bee after 5000 iterations}
\end{figure}


Second, we can observe in Fig. 9 that introducing two new bees
simultaneously increases the stimuli. The new introduced $\theta$ tend to go first to the maximal value of 1000, before that two of them suddently decrease to zero. This abrupt decrease in $\theta$ coincides exactly with a kick in $x_{61}$. The initial low level of $x_{61}$ tells us that the two new bees decide first not to work at all. However, the transition in the $\theta$ and $s$ shows that at a certain time the stimulus is so high that those bees are pressured to work and after a few iterations an equilibrium is reached.

\label{fig:figure7}
\par\end{centering}

\centering{}\caption{Introduction of two new bees in the society after 5000 iterations}
\end{figure}


We can notice with those two examples, that birth or death of a bee
often disturbed the state the society. However, in our example those effects are amplified
by the small size of the society and it can be observed in Fig. 10
 that larger colonies are less perturbed by the incorporation a few numbers of
new bees.


\subsubsection{Main result}

After a few runs of our new dynamical model, we can start to make some observations. The dynamics of the $\theta_{ij}$ are hard to capture,
because of the complexity of the process. However, simple observations
can be made by considering the $s_{j}$ and the $N(t)$ . First, the
number of bees increases drastically at the beginning of the simulation
before reaching an oscillatory state. Second, cycles can be observed
for the welfare and for the stimuli. The reason behind this cycling effects is that when
the welfare is high many new bees are introduced. Such bees have medium
thresholds and low $x_{ij}$ - to many of those is going to increase the instability of the colony and by extension the stimuli. In opposition,
if the amount of welfare is moderate the number of bees introduced is lower and then
the above mentioned perturbation does not occur.

It is important to notice that the cycles in stimuli have been
observed for most of the runs, however the nice welfare cycles in Fig. 10 can
only be observe if the phase difference between the two stimuli are not
to important.

\subsubsection{Comments}

Deeper analysis could be useful to have a more precise idea of the
dynamics behind this model. For example, it would be interesting to
determine the conditions either under which the colony disappears or under
which a dynamical equilibrium can be found. Furthermore, it would
be interesting to test the reactions of the model to a higher number
of tasks. In conclusion, this dynamical evolution of the colony size
opens a wide range of new investigation possibilities and this extension
is a key step towards a more precise and general model.


 

\subsection{PBM Model}
The PBM model is quite robust and a broad range of parameters deliver sensible results. Below we describe the influence of the more important parameters on time-dependant quantities such as allocated tasks, productivities, boredoms and salaries. 

Parameters for a standard simulation could be the following: $N=7$, $M=3$, $\lambda=0.01$, $\kappa=0.003$, $\zeta=0.001$, $\eta=0.0003$, $p_s=0.003$, $\Delta t=1$, $A_\mu=3$, $A_\sigma=0.7$, $P_\mu=2$, $P_\sigma=0.7$, $B_\mu=0.5$, $B_\sigma=0.15$. Figure~\ref{fig:sim1task} shows the time evolution of the tasks performed by the different workers. It allows to see the dynamics of work allocation. Figures~\ref{fig:sim1prod}, \ref{fig:sim1money} and \ref{fig:sim1boredom} allow to understand the motivation for choosing another task. Figure~\ref{fig:sim1prod} shows the evolution of the productivity at the current tasks and explains why workers performing the same task do not earn the same amount of money, which can be seen in Figure~\ref{fig:sim1money}. Figure~\ref{fig:sim1boredom} displays the evolution of the boredom. It illustrates that a too high boredom can induce a change of task even if the new task is less paid than the previous one. A general observation is that people working on tasks at which their maximam boredom is high tend to change the task rapidly because of the rapid increase of the boredom. Figure~\ref{fig:sim1totalmoney} shows the total amount of money earned so far by each of the workers. It features a pronounced social inequality, which is caused by two main factors. Firstly, the inherent characteristics of the workers make some of them much more productive, thence earning more money. The second factor has its origin in the society, more precisely in the production of other individuals; it could be illustrated by the fact that a not particularly skilled individual will be remunerated a lot if he is the only one able to do his job, while two very skilled individuals at the same task will earn much less.

\end{figure}

The randomness used in generation of the productivities $P_{ij}$ and of the abilities $A_i$ allow the inspection of social inequality. Both quantities have a similar influence, with the difference that the differences in $P_{ij}$ are both task- and worker-specific, while the differences in $A_i$ are worker-specific. Setting the standard deviation of the distributions to zero would result in a model with much less social inequality, which is not the scope of the present model. The larger the standard deviation, the more pronounced the social inequalities will be. Figures~\ref{fig:sd1} and \ref{fig:sd2} illustrate the influence of the standard deviation used for the generation of the abilities and the initial productivities on social inequality.

	\label{fig:sd2}
\end{figure}
The boredom can be seen as the main reason for choosing a new task. Figure~\ref{fig:noboredom} was obtained by using $\zeta=0$ instead of $\zeta=0.001$ as above. It displays a prompt work specialization, illustrated by the fact that after a short equilibration period, there are no more task changes due to the absence of boredom. 
Figure~\ref{fig:moreboredom1} and \ref{fig:moreboredom2}, on the other hand, were obtained with $\zeta=0.01$ and $B_\mu=1.5$. They show the more frequent task changes and the higher average boredom. It is to be noted that the high sensitivity to boredom in this case does not diminish the social inequalities, which can be seen in Figure~\ref{fig:moreboredom3}. 

The randomness in the generation of $B_{ij}^\textrm{max}$ allows the differenciated sensibility to boredom, which, as mentioned above, has an influence on the rate at which an individual will change tasks.

Another cause for a change in the task is the evolution of the market, meaning that a worker is more likely to leave his current task if a new individuum just joined the new task, thus lowering the average salary.

	\label{fig:moreboredom3}
\end{figure}

The parameter $p_s$ becomes important when task changes become frequent and a smaller value for $p_s$ will result in less frequent task changes. However, changing $p_s$ above a specific threshold will have a negligible influence, as the additional time a worker has to wait after a new task has become more profitable will change only little.
